    <p>We perform an EDA to discover how human culture and events have progressed over time. Here, we use statistical signals, i.e., tf-idf, to identify when certain phrases (corresponding to discrete entities of human culture and events) are popular and relevant.</p>
    <img src="assets/images/history_timeline.png" width="450">
    <p>We use tf-idf to measure a phrase's relevance in time where each phrase is a term and each period of time (e.g. a year or decade) is a document. We use sublinear term frequency (tf) scaling to reduce the significance of very common phrases (e.g. "film", "life") that are uninformative in our analysis. Given a tf-idf vector for each period of time, we then normalize each tf-idf vector to have a Euclidean norm of 1.</p>
    <p>Applying tf-idf to phrases in this way provides us with a method to rank phrases by their relevance for each time period. We define "top" phrases as the phrases with the highest tf-idf values for the corresponding period of time.</p>
    <p>We show the top phrases by decade below. To provide context, we annotate each phrase with the name and year of the highest-grossing movie out of all movies that contain that phrase in that decade.</p>

    <p>We now highlight significant phrases by decade:
        <ul>
            <li><b>1900s</b>: It is important to note that the earliest commercial movie screening occurred in 1895 and thus movies were still a relatively new phenomenon in the early 1900s. Top phrases in this decade do not appear to be very salient but do reference objects that may be associated with the early 20th century such as "horse" and "train".</li>
            <li><b>1910s</b>: Many of the top phrases and their corresponding top movies in this decade relate to Australia, which is reasonable since the Commonwealth of Australia was established in 1901. This includes the phrases "bushranger" (an outlaw living in the Australian bush), "Melbourne", and "Australian" and the movies <i>The Squatter's Daughter</i>, <i>Moora Neya, or The Message of the Spear</i>, <i>Mates from the Murrumbidgee</i>, <i>Moonlite</i>, and <i>For Australia</i>.</li>
            <li><b>1920s</b>: The most salient top phrases in this decade, "Stan and Ollie" and "Laurel and Hardy", refer to the internationally famous comedy duo Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, whose act was active from the 1920s to 1950s.</li>

            <li><b>1950s</b>: We continue to see phrases and movies relating to World War II, including the movie <i>Giant</i>. We see the appearance of movie characters The Bowery Boys and the reappearance of Moe and Larry. We also see the phrase "Puddy Tat" from Tweety's catchphrase "I Taut I Taw a Puddy-Tat" from the Sylvester and Tweety cartoons and the phrase "mousehole" from the <i>Tom and Jerry</i> cartoon series.</li>
            <li><b>1960s</b>: We continue to see phrases and movies relating to World War II.

We see the appearance of movie characters Speedy Gonzales from the <i>Looney Tunes</i> and <i>Merrie Melodies</i> cartoon series.</li>
            <li><b>1970s</b>: Many of the top phrases and their corresponding top movies in this decade relate to the Vietnam War, fought from 1955 to 1975, including the phrases "Vietnam" and "Vietnam War". Other top phrases and their corresponding top movies relate to martial arts, including the phrases "kung fu" and "Shaolin". During this time, martial arts movies rose in popularity, such as those featuring Bruce Lee, which helped lead to an increase in Asian and Asian American representation in cinema. We see the appearance of movie characters Tora-san from the <i>Otoko wa Tsurai yo</i> Japanese film series and film historian and critic Stuart Galbraith IV.</li>
            <li><b>1980s</b>: We continue to see phrases and movies relating to the Vietnam War. We see the appearance of America's CIA, founded in 1947, and the Soviet Union's KGB, formed in 1954, two opposing security/intelligence agencies whose appearance in movies may have been popularized by the Cold War during this time period. We see the appearance of Indian cinema in the form of actors Mithun Chakraborty in <i>Kismet</i>, considered to be one of the foundational films of Bollywood, Lizy in <i>Arante Mulla Kochu Mulla</i>, and Rati Agnihotri in <i>Ullasa Paravaigal</i>.

            <li><b>1990s</b>: The top phrase in this decade is "HIV", which was first clinically observed in 1981, triggering much of the early HIV/AIDS research in the 1980s. This development may have led to HIV/AIDS being recognized by popular culture in the following years; in fact, the top movie corresponding to "HIV", <i>Philadelphia</i>, was one of the first mainstream Hollywood movies to mention HIV/AIDS. We continue to see phrases and movies relating to the CIA and Vietnam War. We see technologies that may have been more readily accessible to consumers in the late 20th century, such as "video", "tv", "videotape", and "answering machine". We see the appearance of movie character Simran Singh in another Bollywood movie, <i>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</i> and the reappearance of Mithun.</li>
            <li><b>2000s</b>: The top phrase in this decade is "heart attack". It is unclear why, but as a continuously leading cause of death since the mid-20th century, cardiovascular disease may have been especially prevalent in popular culture in this time period. We see top phrases relating to the September 11 attacks, namely "September 11" and "9/11". We continue to see technologies that are relevant to consumers in this time period, namely "laptop" and "internet". We see the appearance of "hip hop", which became the top-selling music genre by 1999 and continued to become increasingly popular throughout the 2000s.

Santhanam in <i>Thillalangadi</i> and the reappearance of Sneha in <i>Theeradha Vilaiyattu Pillai</i>.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>We see that examining and researching top phrases over time gives us valuable insight into human culture and its public attitudes, events, people, ideas, etc. Phrase mining and the use of tf-idf automatically identifies relevant keywords in a way that would be difficult to do manually or by using traditional text mining methods.</p>
    <p>We also provide an animated bar chart race of the top phrases by year, rather than decade, below.</p>
