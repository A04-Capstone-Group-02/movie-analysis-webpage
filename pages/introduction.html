    Movies often capture human culture and major events throughout time. We can
    retrieve these expressions of human culture and events through a
    comprehensive textual analysis of movie plots. Here, we propose an analysis
    of movie plots through the use of phrase mining to extract key phrases that
    correspond to discrete entities of human culture and events. Such an
    analysis can help us better understand change of popular topics, public
    attitudes, major themes, and how overall human culture has progressed
    throughout history. This analysis is novel since we extract history from
    movies, an unconventional source, instead of relying on historical texts
    directly; we expect such a study to provide a unique perspective as a
    result. In addition, we expect such a study to be especially useful for
    history non-experts, as we extract key phrases which can provide relevant
    and insightful keywords for further research by the reader. We perform this
    analysis on a large dataset of movie plot summaries from English movies over
    the past century. Previous work addresses either a comprehensive analysis of
    movie history or the use of phrase mining for natural language processing,
    but not both. Previous analyses of movies are limited since they tend to use
    extract words or phrases via the use of raw frequencies instead of a
    sophisticated phrase mining technique such as AutoPhrase. Here, we explore a
    novel approach to apply phrase mining to the analysis of movies.
