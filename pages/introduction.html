    Movies constantly surround us, whether it be action movies, dramas, or documentaries. Movies are often intended for entertainment and education but also serve as a rich source of human culture from which we can derive insight.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this project, we explore a comprehensive textual analysis of movie plot summaries in order to better understand human culture. Such an analysis can help us better understand popular topics, public attitudes, and the overall progression and themes of human culture throughout history.

  <p>
    Our analysis is unique in two ways:
    <ol>
      <li>We extract human culture from movies instead of relying on traditional sources, e.g., historical texts.</li>
      <li>We make use of phrase mining to extract relevant phrases to use in our analysis. This differs from rudimentary methods such as the naive extraction of n-grams that often lead to incomplete or spurious phrases.</li>
    </ol>
