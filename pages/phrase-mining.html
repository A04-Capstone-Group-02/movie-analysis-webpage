    As described earlier, we make use of phrase mining in our analysis. We first extract key phrases from <span style="font-family:ui-monospace">summary</span> using <a href="https://github.com/shangjingbo1226/AutoPhrase">AutoPhrase</a>,  a phrase mining framework that extracts high-quality phrases from a given text. We use AutoPhrase for its ability to extract high-quality phrases more effectively than traditional, rudimentary, phrase mining techniques, while maintaining minimal human effort during training.

    We first train AutoPhrase on all movie plot summaries in the dataset, then extract the key phrases from each individual summary and add these phrases as a variable in our dataset as shown below.
  </p>
  <table class="variables">
    <thead>
      <tr>
          <td>Variable</td>
          <td>Description</td>
          <td>Example</td>
      </tr>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><code>phrases</code></td>
          <td>Phrases extracted from <code>summary</code></td>
          <td>{alderaan, anakin skywalker, assault, aunt and uncle, bay, c-3po, chewbacca, civil war, commanding officer, darth vader, ...}</td>

    An example of phrases extracted from a movie plot summary by AutoPhrase is shown below.

    The <mark>film</mark> begins with an opening crawl explaining that the <mark>galaxy</mark> is in a <mark>state</mark> of <mark>civil war</mark> and that spies for the <mark>Rebel Alliance</mark> have <mark>stolen</mark> plans to the Galactic Empire's <mark>Death Star</mark>, a <mark>heavily armed</mark> and armored <mark>space station</mark> capable of annihilating an <mark>entire planet</mark>. <mark>Rebel leader</mark> <mark>Princess Leia</mark> is in possession of the plans, but her <mark>ship</mark> is captured by Imperial forces under the command of the evil <mark>lord</mark> <mark>Darth Vader</mark>.

    Nearly all extracted phrases are indeed high-quality and encapsulate ideas, events, objects, and characters in the movie plot well.

  <p>
    Now that the data is processed and phrases are extracted, we start an analysis consisting of three parts that build off of the extracted phrases:
    <ol>
      <li>An exploratory data analysis (EDA) that examines the progression of human culture over time.</li>
      <li>The development and interpretation of a classification model that predicts movie genre.</li>
      <li>The development and interpretation of a clustering model that clusters movies.</li>
    </ol>
