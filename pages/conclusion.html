  <p>So far we demonstrated the application of phrase mining to movie plots, a novel approach for the textual analysis of movies, for a unique insight into human culture.</p>
  <p>To recap:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the EDA investigation, we use statistical signals to select the most relevant phrases describing each time period.</li>
    <li>In the classification investigation, we explore different classification methods for best genre prediction performance</li>
    <li>In the clustering investigation, we use pretrained language models and quality phrases to discover relationships between movies in a weakly supervised perspective.</li>
  </ul>

  In each of these investigations, we demonstrate phrase mining's effectiveness in producing valuable insight into human culture and offer yet another example of learning valuable insight from an unconventional data source using data science.
